# Python Rotating Cube
A simple 3D rotating cube visualization built using Python and Pygame. This project demonstrates how to render a 3D object and apply basic transformations such as rotation in real-time.

Features
3D cube rendered using 2D projections.
Real-time rotation along different axes.
Adjustable rotation speed and angle.
Interactive keyboard controls to modify the cubeâ€™s rotation.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Allenreinoso28/Python-Rotating-Cube.git
cd Python-Rotating-Cube
Install required dependencies:

Ensure you have Python installed. Install Pygame by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Usage
Run the script to start the rotating cube visualization:

bash
Copy code
python rotating_cube.py
Controls
Use the arrow keys to control the cube's rotation:
Up/Down Arrows: Rotate around the X-axis.
Left/Right Arrows: Rotate around the Y-axis.
Press Esc to exit the program.
Screenshots

Future Improvements
Add lighting and shading effects.
Implement support for 3D objects other than cubes.
Improve performance for larger scenes.
